# NYC Real Estate Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the factors influencing property values in New York City using a dataset derived from public records and real estate listings. The analysis covers a range of techniques from data preparation to advanced regression modeling to provide insights into the dynamics of the NYC real estate market.

## Motivation
