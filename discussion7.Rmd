## Question 8

If a coin is tossed a sequence of times, what is the probability that the first head will occur after the fifth toss, given that it has not occurred in the first two tosses?
```{r}
# Probability of event A intersect B
prob_A_intersect_B <- 1/8

# Probability of event B
prob_B <- 1 - 1/2 * 1/2

# Probability of A given B
prob_A_given_B <- prob_A_intersect_B / prob_B

prob_A_given_B
```
